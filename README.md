# Etch-a-Sketch
In this repo, I want to recreate a simple version of Etch-a-Sketch, a toy that many of us have played with. I will be incorporating front-end technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
How to use: 
When the user opens the application, there will be a form, asking the user to enter the a number, which Javascript will then generate a square grid of that number. The user can then mouseover the sketchpad and see that the default color is red. I have added 3 other features: erase, clear, and rainbow. 
Erase: when the user clicks this option and hovers over the sketchpad, it will erase any edits that the user made. 
Clear: this option will clear the entire sketchpad and let the user starts over. (NOTE: user has to enter a number for the grid to be generate again).
Rainbow: this option will randomly generate a different color everytime the user hovers a SINGLE box.
